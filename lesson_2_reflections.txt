What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git will create some metadata to start tracking the repository. Because without it, Git would not know which files are being tracked, and not tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains snapshots that are about to commit to the repository. Working directory is just an OS directory, it contains everything inside it. 
The repository contains commits. The staging area allows us to make a commit with changes in multiple files.
