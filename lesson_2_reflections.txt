What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Git will create some metadata to start tracking the repository. Because without it, Git would not know which files are being tracked, and not tracked.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area contains snapshots that are about to commit to the repository. Working directory is just an OS directory, it contains everything inside it. 
The repository contains commits. The staging area allows us to make a commit with changes in multiple files.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

I can use `git diff --staged` to review the changes between staging area and the lastest commit to ensure one commit per logical change

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

Branches are helpful when I need to work on a thing but not finished yet, but then I need to work on an emergency thing. I need to save my half-done work somewhere. Branches are excellent for that situation.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagram shows me what a branch is actually a tipping point, a commit. And it explains why a checkout will cause a detached HEAD.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging to branches will create a new commit that has two parents to the latest commits on the current branch and the other branch.
