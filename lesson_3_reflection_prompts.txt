When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to use a remote repository when I want to keep my files for backup for future use, in case I lost my computer or it's broken
Or I want to collborate with my team on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because when I'm working on coding, I don't want git interfere with my workflow. It also might be the version on the remote is buggy.
