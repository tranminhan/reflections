When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I want to use a remote repository when I want to keep my files for backup for future use, in case I lost my computer or it's broken
Or I want to collborate with my team on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because when I'm working on coding, I don't want git interfere with my workflow. It also might be the version on the remote is buggy. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is a copy of a repository of someone else, and it usually means a repository on a remote server.
A clone is also a copy of a repository, but usually in a local machine.
A branch lives within a repository, it has a commit history for a particular work.
